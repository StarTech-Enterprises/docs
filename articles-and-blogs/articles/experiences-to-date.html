<p>A big thanks to Harsh Batra (Vice President of Ethos Data) for arranging this! And also to all the other great people - colleagues, coaches, mentors, and friends - I’ve had the opportunity to work with so far in my career!</p>

<p>Sachin Tandon is one of the smartest, humblest, guys I have ever known. In this wide ranging conversation, we go back in time, to unravel his career journey to date - how, and why, he ended up studying and working at the places he did (at some very well-known institutions across the world), and then after some years working as a company employee, took the big leap into independent freelancing, to see if that is where he could work for companies and industries on the problems he was most passionate about.</p>

<p>I personally see him as a collector of experiences. Someone with a strong foundation of skills - that takes decades to acquire - but underlying it all, a childish curiosity to want to keep learning and keep growing - with humility, focus, and gratitude at its very core.</p>

<p>The skill sets, and dimension of understanding he brings to businesses, (in his freelancing capacity, “Star Tech Enterprises”) is something very unique to the business universe! If you get the opportunity to work with him, I’d say you, and your business, are very lucky!</p>

<p>You can read all about him, in this interview below. It’s quite an length, but very comprehensive read, and definitely all worth it!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Harsh Batra - (VP of Ethos Data)</p>

<p>In this one to one, Sachin Tandon talks through some of his career highlights to date: from his early experiences in Business Consulting, Assurance, and Finance at PwC, in London, to his then later experiences in International Commerce at Manchester Business School, in Manchester, U.K., to then some of his more recent entrepreneurial stints, working with companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, WPP, Diageo, the Omnicom Media Group.</p>

<p>Sachin currently freelances through his own small company, Star-Tech Enterprises, a small venture he set up, with the mission of wanting to “<em>to support businesses around the world – large multi-nationals, medium-sized companies, and small and innovative start-ups – to achieve more!</em>” – He particularly focuses on those companies in the Technology &amp; Engineering, and Media &amp; Entertainment sectors.</p>

<p>Sachin has led quite a “<strong><em>non-linear</em></strong>” career to date. After completing a degree in General Engineering at the University of Cambridge, U.K., and then M.I.T., Boston, the U.S., he began his graduate career at the Professional Services firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), in London, the U.K. After this, he did his MBA from Manchester Business School, the U.K., before then taking the very “entrepreneurial leap”, of turning his home into his own start-up / freelancing headquarters, to pursue what he felt like, was a small gap in the market, and also strongly growing area of interest for him.</p>

<p>What follows is a transcript of my conversation with Sachin, where along with some his career highlights, he shares some important life lessons, and tells us how it’s all going, and what he hopes to do next.</p>

<p><strong>Sachin thanks for taking the time to do this!</strong></p>

<p>Hello Harsh! Thanks for having me!</p>

<p><strong>So, Sachin, just looking at your career history to date, you’ve definitely gone on and done a lot of different things - more than I might possibly say of most – but it’s clear to me at least, that you have taken a strong liking to business. As a younger boy, when you were growing up, did you always have an ambition to get into business? Was it something always on the radar when you were coming through the schooling system you grew up in?</strong></p>

<p>No, not really. When I was young, I was always quite focused on my schoolwork. Outside school, in my free time, I used to watch a lot of films by Stephen Spielberg, and read books by H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, Isaak Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke. I thought one day, I wanted to learn more about what Film Directors did, or some create whacky flying gadget, or flying machine, and become some kind of Engineering Rocket Scientist when I was younger. But then also, after watching TV series like Ally McBeal, and Due South, I thought I might want to become some kind of Lawyer, or be a Mounty Police Officer, with a Siberian Husky, called Diefenbaker.</p>

<p>It was only until much later, perhaps 22 or 23, when I started to better understand what a few of these professions really meant – that I felt I might want to spend most of my career, not just researching and experimenting, like what many Engineering Rocket Scientists might do, but a career where I could also spend more time working with people, doing innovative and creative things, - sometimes crazy things – but in a career where I could help other people – which is really, what I think, a successful career in business is all about!</p>

<p><strong>That’s great. You’ve achieved quite a lot in your career so far – and I see gone on to some pretty impressive places, and done work equally impressive. What, in your own mind, do you think you would put your success down to?</strong></p>

<p>Well, if I had to name just one thing, it would be tenacity!</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I’ve recognised the importance of dealing with both success and failure. And where I’ve met with success, I’ve tried to build on those successes, but at the same time, just as importantly, whenever I’ve failed, I’ve always tried to ensure I’ve learnt from the experience – so I can “<em>bounce back</em>” from those not so good experiences, learn from them, and have another go!</p>

<p>That <strong><em>tenacity</em></strong> (or <strong><em>perseverance</em></strong>, if you will), along with the ability to communicate <strong><em>clearly</em></strong>, with <strong><em>empathy</em></strong>, and form <strong><em>strong relationships</em></strong> with people, I would say have been the critical success factor to any life and work success I think I’ve had so far.</p>

<p>I remember once, in a work interview, I was once asked: what is the one trait I would most like to be remembered for. And, at the time I can remember saying: “<strong><em>Just never giving up</em></strong>”. I think that one trait, has and always be something, I will carry with me.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin! Do you think it is these qualities that have allowed you to get on well with the people you have worked with so far?</strong></p>

<p>I think it was one of the really important things, for definite.</p>

<p>When I think about the people I really admire and look up to, we often both have a number of things in common, but also a number of things that are different too. But that idea of “<strong><em>Just never giving up</em></strong>”, and always “<strong><em>Striving for excellence</em></strong>” are qualities we both have often shared.</p>

<h2 id="university---engineering">University - Engineering</h2>

<p><strong>I see that after your primary and secondary schooling, you went to University, and did a Master’s Degree in Manufacturing Engineering. After school, why did you decide to do that and pursue Higher Education? How was it?</strong></p>

<p>For me, I just saw going to University as a natural next step from Further Education and schooling system I had grown up in. I had worked hard (put in a lot of time, energy, and effort) into my “A-level” subjects, and then early on in my second year of Sixth Form College, knew that I was also on track to getting high grades in the subjects I took.</p>

<p>At the time, my thinking was that I wanted to follow in my Father’s and Grandfather’s footsteps and pursue my Higher Education in Engineering. Both my Dad and Grandfather had studied Engineering when they went to college. Both had worked as Engineers early on in their careers.</p>

<p>My Grandfather was a Civil Engineer and used to design and build Hydro-Electric dams, in India in the 1970s and 1980s, because he aspired to reduce the country’s reliance on Fossil Duels.</p>

<p>My Father started his career working as a Chemical Engineer for companies like Dunlop, and Slazenger, designing innovative Tennis balls and Tennis racquets – Racquets that were made from lighter composite materials, and Tennis Balls filled with more complex gases that made the them last longer and bounce better. After Dunlop, he then worked for some years at companies such as: Bowater, Rexam, and Bonnar, to help them design and make polythene rolls – those used for wrapping the Bales of Hay you see dotted around the English countryside, before then moving onto a more International career in General Management.</p>

<p>So, aspiring to follow a similar path, I basically also thought I too would want to go to a well-known University, to read Engineering. A University that was well-resourced, had a good facilities, and admitted a lot of motivated, smart, and ambitious students, who I could learn a lot from.</p>

<p>After doing some research, I saw that Cambridge was highly ranked in the League Tables, and that both its Engineering course, and Undergraduate Teaching had a very strong global reputation. I was also left with a positive impression after visiting them at an Open-Day. So, I decided to try my luck and apply. Then, after a couple of interviews, I was lucky enough to be accepted on their 4 Year Masters of Engineering programme, at the college, Gonville &amp; Caius.</p>

<p>As to how it was, overall, I had a really enjoyable time. My college, Gonville &amp; Caius was one of the smaller ones – but still very idyllic, and cosy. It was conveniently located close to the City Centre, where all the shops were, and wasn’t very far either from the University’s main Engineering department.</p>

<p>The college itself had a very nice, close-knit, community feel to it! Our supervisors and professors were really wonderful people - very passionate about teaching, about the subjects they taught, and about the well-being of its students. Gonville &amp; Caius college itself had a very diverse mix of International students, with students that read not just Engineering, but subjects ranging all the way from: Medicine, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Languages, Music, Economics, Philosophy, Computer Science, to the Classics, and English Literature.</p>

<p>It also had, what some people today might call, mini celebrities – for example, I distinctly remember meeting Stephen Hawking, the Theoretic Physicist and Cosmologist, a few times; he was an Honorary fellow of the college. Then, I also think Ken Clark, the Conservative Party politician, and for a brief time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was also a student of Gonville &amp; Caius, where he had read for his degree in Law.</p>

<p>Going back to what I did, I would say the Engineering course at the University was very tough – very theoretical, and underpinned by a lot of very advanced maths - where we were challenged to solve a lot of very complex Maths &amp; Engineering problems (Example Papers, or P-Sets, as they used to call them).</p>

<p>And, then, because I did well in my first and second years, in my third year, I was selected to go onto the competitive exchange program at the Technology Institute, M.I.T. in Boston, the U.S.A. – which was another great experience. After that, I then returned to the U.K. to complete the fourth and final year of my master’s degree.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say, apart from the lectures, and classroom teachings, I found the various lab practicals, and industrial visits to companies, to be very enjoyable and interesting. And, academically, overall, I graduated with a 1st class – which is something I was very pleased with.</p>

<p>So, yes, overall, an all-round great experience!</p>

<h2 id="professional-services---pwc">Professional Services - PwC</h2>

<p><strong>Well, Sachin, that sounds really amazing! It certainly sounds like you had an enjoyable time - lots of hard work, lots of study, but also a lot of opportunity to work with some very diverse, smart and driven people. After you graduated, I see your first full time work experiences were with PwC. How did you end up taking your first steps in the working world, with them?</strong></p>

<p>As with anything, mostly from the work opportunities I had been looking for and which had come to me at the time. As I was thinking about what and where I might want to work next, as a new graduate, I became quite driven by a desire, at least at the start of my career, to want to work for a well-known, well-established global company, that would provide a strong platform and foundation from which I could build my future career.</p>

<p>I had enjoyed some of my earlier Research &amp; Development experiences, in my gap year, before University, and then also over the summers, during University, when I had worked for companies such as: Renishaw, a High Tech Engineering Company, near Bristol, in the U.K., and then after that, the National Broadcasting &amp; Media Company, the BBC, in their Central Communications, and Technology department, in London, the U.K..</p>

<p>I had enjoyed too some of the “<em>Engineering Consultancy</em>” type projects I did, as part of my degree course, in my third and fourth years at University, where I got to visit, just-in-time factories at companies such as: Coty Lipsticks, IMI Norgren, and Rolls Royce, in the U.K., and then later, Hitachi GST, in Japan - to try and help improve certain aspects of their manufacturing activities – e.g. in reducing changeover times on assembly lines, achieving better line balancing between lines, reducing WIP &amp; Inventory levels, reducing lead times, or trying to increase product throughput rates, and so on.</p>

<p>So, when I started thinking ahead, towards the end of my degree, about what I might want next, that was when many of those close to me (family, close friends and classmates, etc.) had encouraged me to consider applying for a full-time job in the field of what was called “<em>Management Consultancy</em>” – to see if that was something I might like do next. There would be some overlap with the skills I had developed, and Engineering experiences I had gained, but also, given my, till then, very Research &amp; Development like experiences, provide me with a newer, and slightly different perspective of business. So, at the time, because I was interested in broadening and deepening my experiences, I thought, why not?</p>

<p>So, that’s when I started focusing my application efforts to that field, and then after applying to a few places, received an offer to work, in my penultimate summer (the summer before the start of my final University year), at a company called PwC, in a their “<em>Transaction Advisory</em>” department, and in that department, for a small division called “<em>The Strategy Group</em>”.</p>

<p>I had an enjoyable time that summer – it was quite different to my earlier gap year, and internship experiences, but still interesting – doing desk-based “<em>Commercial Due Diligence</em>” work for different kinds of companies.</p>

<p>The particular division I worked in, “<em>The Strategy Group</em>”, would often get its work from outside Investment Companies. They would often approach us, because they needed an independent and external team, such as ours, to carry out some independent market research for them, about a particular target company and its market (e.g., about the products and services the company sold, what its positioning was vis a vis its closest competitors, what the latest market trends and developments affecting the company might be, what customer’s opinions about the company were, and any regulatory developments on the horizon, that might affect the industry’s and company’s future growth).</p>

<p>At the end of that summer, the division I had been working in, had extended me an offer to work for them, on a full-time basis. Because I didn’t want to start the fourth year at University without a job offer in hand, I accepted their offer to work full time. Amongst other things, I felt that having an offer in hand would allow me focus much more on the course materials of my 4th year. It allwed me to spend more time planning and preparing for my Manufacturing Engineering Project trip to Japan - where I had gone to work for Hitachi GST for 10 weeks, near Tokyo, on a challenging and interesting just-in-time factory automation project. So, I was quite content with all the decisions I had made.</p>

<p><strong>Again, really great to hear Sachin. Just after you graduated, how did you feel before you moved down from Cambridge to London? I imagine you must have been both quite excited, but also a little nervous, about starting your first full time job?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yes, that’s very true. I felt both excited, but also a little nervous and anxious.</p>

<p>Excited because I knew PwC were considered as one of the top graduate employers in the country, quite well known in many areas in business. I used to often see in the news, news reporters quoting statements from Market Research reports that had been written and published by PwC.</p>

<p>I also knew PwC were a global company, with a large network of international offices, so it would mean opportunities too of working on projects, with people from very different backgrounds and countries, all very motivated to work and learn, which I also saw as a plus!</p>

<p>The offer too was in London, which I was excited about. The city, as a capital city, is considered to be a thriving epicentre for business. There being more commerce and companies, there are more opportunities for career development and progression. Away from business, the city itself is also very diverse and cosmopolitan, with no shortage of things for someone in their mid 20s to do!</p>

<p>But, yes, you’re absolutely right, I was a bit nervous too. But I think this is only natural, and happens whenever you start a new job, move to different city or place, meet new people, etc., for the first time. There are so many new things to find out. There are lots of things you have to learn, very, very quickly. It takes time to settle in.</p>

<p><strong>So, you started at PwC, working in a division called “The Strategy Group”, in the companies “Transaction Advisory” department, doing mostly “Commercial Due Dilligence” work, for external Investment Companies (PE firms, VC firms, sometimes listed Corporates). Then later, I see you started working towards obtaining a Chartered Qualification, in Finance &amp; Accountancy. How did that come about?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yes, that’s exactly right. Just as I had done in the summer before, I stayed with company’s “The Strategy Group” division doing “Commercial Due Diligence” work (for Investment Companies), for about another year.</p>

<p>However, as I met with people from other departments (those closest to me were the “Financial Due Diligence”, and “Market Valuation &amp; Strategy” divisions, within the “Transaction Advisory” department), and learnt more about what these people did, that’s when I discovered how quite a lot of them also held a “Chartered Qualification” – and that many of those at my level in other divisions were also going through separate, structured, training programs to try to obtain one.</p>

<p>From a long-term career standpoint, I felt that getting a Chartered Qualification would definitely stand me in good stead. The CA Qualification, what PwC encourages a lot of its graduates to do, is a well-respected business qualification; is internationally very well recognised; and, also, as you go through the training of the qualification, teaches you a lot of the key skills needed to run a successful business. So, for me, I guess, you could say, I saw the CA in particular as a great opportunity to learn more about things I never really knew much about before: Finance &amp; Accoutancy, which appealed to the entrepreneurial streak in me!</p>

<p>I also felt, after doing the kind of “Commercial Due Dilligence” assignments for about 18 months, that my natural interests, and strengths were starting to gravitate towards solving the more complex kind of “Finance” problems that people in the other departments had been working on, even though I was becoming quite skilled in doing “Commercial Due Dilligence” work!</p>

<p>And, the more I learnt about the Qualification and what people did, the more intrigued I became by what I didn’t know. If I’m honest, it reminded me of some of the kinds of problems I had to solve at some of the just-in-time factories I worked on, when I did my Engineering degree at University.</p>

<p>So, after doing some research, and deciding to make the move, I asked some of the Partners in my division whether it would be possible for me to pursue a CA. Some of the Partners really understood the kind of work I really liked and enjoyed, or how easily bored I would get without a tough challenge, and where my natural strengths and interests were. Many of them encouraged me to find out more. Some did say that a Chartered Qualification might not be something I could pursue from within their division, because of some of the conditions of the Qualification – that you had to do work that was more closely linked to what “Finance” people did, rather than what “Commercial Due Dilligence” people did – which kind of made sense!</p>

<p>So, they introduced me to some of the Partners in the “Financial Due Dilligence” division. Unfortunately, the Partners there said I had just missed out on the deadline for that year’s intake, and that if I wanted to start the qualification with them, would have to wait for another year. So then, after that, I got some introductions to Partners in some of the other divisions. That’s when, I think, I met quite an open minded Partner from Australia, who said they still had some room for a few people to work in the company’s “Investment Management Group” division, and that they would be willing to take me on, and sponsor me for my CA!</p>

<p>So, that’s when I quite enthusiastically took up the offer, and then ended up moving across from the company’s “The Strategy Group” division to the company’s “Investment Management Group” division</p>

<p>Though the work was a little different in the “Investment Management Group” division (more mathematical / financial in nature, and had involved a lot more travel to client offices – and so I was developing a different skill set) – the work was still quite interesting. I was able to learn quite a lot, particularly in topics such “Finance &amp; Accountancy”, “Law”, and “Tax” - business topics that were all completely new to me! I was also getting some practical experience in learning how to value different kinds of “Financial Investments” (there are many different ways!), and how to build different kinds of “Financial Acquisition” models (there are many different models! - VC models, Private Equity models, LBO models, etc..). The experience too, of working for different clients, also gave me a better appreciation, first hand, of some of the challenges and risks that might be faced when running a business.</p>

<p>I also came to the realisation that Finance is something that sits at the beating heart of any business, and is area that is very important to understand, and get to grips with, in business, more generally!</p>

<p>So, after working in the firm’s “Strategy Group Division”, I ended up working in the firms “The Investment Management Group” division for 3 years, to do and complete my CA training!</p>

<p><strong>I’m so happy to hear that Sachin! I know from a lot of people that the CA can be a very challenging qualification to get. Any Chartered Qualification, in any domain, especially one that takes 3 years to obtain, is a challenge to get! It’s something that needs a lot of dedication, focus and commitment, not just because of all the tough exams you have to sit – but also because you have to work in a demanding full-time job at the same time! So, congratulations on persisting with that! So, I wonder, after you qualified, and got your Chartered Qualification, what did you decide to do next?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the day I qualified and got my CA, I went out and celebrated with friends who went through the same training. I remember going out and buying myself a very expensive bottle of Champagne - (a Dom Perignon, I distinctly remember)! Thar was a great feeling!</p>

<p>In terms of actual work, I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted to do next. Quite a few people in my peer group, in my division, moved across to other departments. Some left the company to pursue their own thing. My bosses in “<strong>The Investment Management Group</strong>” were quite pleased with the progress I had been making, and work I was doing. I think they also saw me as a very valuable team member that was giving them good continuity to my then main client – “The Wellcome Trust” – the London based, Medical Research Charity.</p>

<p>Personally, I also didn’t feel like I needed to move anywhere else immediately. I had established a good relationship with the various people in the Finance and Investment departments at “The Wellcome Trust”. I also felt like I was doing good work, still getting some good work experience, still learning new things, and able also to develop my management, supervisory, coaching and mentoring skills, as other, less experienced members joined my team. So, I decided to stay, with my division for another 2 years – and ended up working with the “Investment Management Group”, in London, for a full 5 years.</p>

<p>It was a pretty amazing extra 2 years too! I continued to work for my main client, the Medical Research Charity “<strong>The Wellcome Trust</strong>”, doing finance type of work (financial modelling, financial valuations, financial negotiations, financial assurance, financial advisory work, etc.), and was able to work for a variety of other companies too! For example, for the Engineering Construction Company (<strong>Balfour Beauty</strong>) – on a Renewable Energy Fund they were looking to set up; for the Pharmaceutical Company (<strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>); for two Commercial Real Estate Companies (<strong>Land Securities</strong>, and <strong>Deutsche Bank RREEF</strong>); For a short time, the firms “Sustainability &amp; Climate Change Group” division – working on a project for the IMF (<strong>International Monetary Fund</strong>), to help them create a new Climate Investment Fund to invest in new Renewable Energy projects – which was something I was interested in being a part of… thinking about the work my Grandfather did in designing and building Hydroelectric Dams.</p>

<p><strong>Well Sachin, it certainly sounds like you got involved in plenty of projects and areas, working for companies across quite a few sectors. When you were there, working towards both your Qualification AND for the company’s Clients, how was juggling that? What would you now say to other people, perhaps new graduates or other young professionals, who might be aspiring to follow a very similar path, early on in their career?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I would say, as with any path, there can be both peaks and troughs, and I found that to be the case with my experiences.</p>

<p>Before I started at PwC, some people would warn me of the sometimes very long hours I would have to work, both in the company’s “Transaction Advisory” department, but particularly the company’s “The Investment Management Group” division – and that too, the CA, at a Professional Services firm, was no easy thing to get! They warned me of how hard and challenging it would be!</p>

<p>I will admit, the hours were long. That I can say! But I think, the hours were probably just as long in the company’s other divisions too. I also think that when you’re starting something new, whatever company or industry that may be in, and when “high achievement” is your goal, when do you not have to put in some long hours?</p>

<p>Initially, when I started out, I did sometimes find working as the most “junior” person quite frustrating (as is probably only natural when you are the youngest person in the office!). You can end up being given a lot of mundane work, and you might not get to participate in as many client meetings, as you might like to, compared to those more senior to you. But, again, I think, the same is probably true at a lot of places, and depends heavily on what knowledge and skills you already have, and what you can realistically, from your experiences, bring to the table!</p>

<p>Overall, when I look back at those years, I did feel like I was able to learn a tremendous amount, from both the formal training I went through, but also some of the people I worked with – motivated, smart, very hard working – some of whom I am still in quite close touch with today!</p>

<p>In these kinds of companies, you can end up working with people – managers, partners, and so forth - who can be really difficult to deal with. But I think, it is important to not let that affect your work, or for you to be affected by that kind of environment!</p>

<p>One thing I would say that I did not like, was that I had a lot of outside interests and hobbies: Tennis, Cricket, Formula 1, Films &amp; Music, Health &amp; Fitness, and Cooking, amongst others. I also wanted to spend more time socialising with friends, outside of work, and to visit more places, socially, in London.</p>

<p>But because of the long hours, I personally found these difficult to fit in. The volumes of work can be very high, and when working in the firm’s Assurance department, had to work to fairly pressing deadlines. And trying to maintain this, whilst working towards obtaining my CA, for 3 years, I did not find easy. It wasn’t impossible, but it was a lot of hours and a lot hard work, and I had to sacrifice quite a lot in terms of my social life and social activities, (work across a lot of weekends, for a full 3 years) – which was tough!</p>

<p><em>So, what I would say to others that might be considering following a similar path?</em></p>

<p>I think it really depends on what you want from the experience, and how you think it will help with your long-term career goals. Your career goals are likely to change and shift overtime – this is only natural! Everyone’s career goals change slightly, in some way, over time!</p>

<p>But, I think, you should try to think about how, from the experiences you will get, however many years that might be, what pathways and roles those experiences will open up for you afterwards -  should you do decide to leave, and go on to do something else.</p>

<p>So, try to get some advice beforehand - from friends, career coaches, experienced mentors, potential sponsors, or other people you trust. Doing this, and seeing how the experience fits into your Master Plan, and Bigger Career Picture, will definitely help you become more committed and convinced about any decisions you have to make. This will in turn help you to move forward with a stronger sense of purpose and conviction!</p>

<p>When I look back at my own experiences: - after getting a lot of encouragement from family and friends, to apply to companies and roles they felt would give me a new insight into Business, different from the mainly “Research &amp; Development” experiences I had till then, I decided to apply to the Professional Services companies, and got an offer to start working for PwC to get that different perspective.</p>

<p>The offer I got gave me me a great chance to work for a well-known, well-regarded company, one that was large enough that it gave me the opportunity to work with people from different countries and backgrounds, as we worked together to solve tough and challenging business problems.</p>

<p>And in the 5 to 6 years I was there, I felt I had achieved quite a lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got an interesting mixture of experiences in Finance, and Business Consulting, from the company’s “Business Assurance” and “Transaction Advisory” departments.</li>
  <li>I came out with a Chartered Qualification, a CA – a well-recognised qualification, that I had worked really hard to get, and which taught me a lot about Finance &amp; Accountancy, and about Tax.</li>
  <li>I felt like I had worked for quite a wide range of companies too, (both financial, and non-financial – private and public, and some listed FTSE 100 companies) - companies I felt I may not have gotten the opportunity to work for had I perhaps worked elsewhere</li>
  <li>It gave me too a much better appreciation of the different kinds of risks that might be faced when running a business</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it has definitely helped me towards achieving my long term career goals – of “one day” being able to work as a Senior Business Leader, for a company in the “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>”, or “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sectors.</p>

<p>But going back to answering the original question - what I would say to others considering pursuing a similar path: well, the hours can be long and intense. And in the early years (not months, but 2 to 3 years), you will likely have to sacrifice quite a lot in terms of the other extra-curricular activities you might want to pursue.</p>

<p>That said, the hard work you do put in will eventually pay off. You will definitely learn about Business, and you will definitely, if you decide to do your CA Qualification, get to work on solving some pretty “complex” problems, and learn more about “Finance &amp; Accountancy”. So, it is something that will definitely provide you with a very strong foundation to build on for the rest of your career.</p>

<p>But, I would also say that this is just the path that I happened to choose, from the opportunities that came to me at different moments. Other people, in their own minds, might want to pursue slightly different paths. Some people may already have in their minds a very strong “<strong><em>sector focus</em></strong>” and know from the outset what “<strong><em>sector</em></strong>” they want to work in, and focus all their application efforts there. Then, once they are in that sector, I guess, what happens after that, will just depend on what they want to do and what “<strong><em>roles</em></strong>” they think might want to work in, from the opportunities they create for themselves afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="business-school---mba">Business School - MBA</h2>

<p><strong>Thank you for sharing that Sachin! I’m sure some of our readers will really appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences in this way – I personally, don’t think very many people, from the outset, ever really figure out their entire career path out completely, or ever try to be too savvy about following a career path in exactly the way they might have originally imagined. But everyone eventually does find their own path, and true compass.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, tell me more. As you were working at PwC, why after 6 years did you decide to leave your role, to pursue your MBA?</strong></p>

<p>Really, the honest answer is that I just saw it as another challenge. Getting a Chartered Qualification was a challenge, I found my work, initially, in PwC’s “Transaction Advisory” department quite a challenge. Then the work in their “Business Assurance” department, in the “Investment Management Group” division also a challenge. Then, after working there for about 5 years, I was just looking for a change. And I saw the MBA as another challenge – that would also stand me in good stead for my career.</p>

<p>Reflecting on all the skills I have gained, I saw that my Masters in Engineering degree had honed my quantitative and analytical skills, and given me a good understanding of operations management, and cultivated an interest too in Technology. I then saw that my experiences at PwC had given me a very good grounding and understanding of Finance &amp; Accounting, and gradually too, better appreciation of some of the risks involved in running a business, from an operational and financial perspective.</p>

<p>Next, from my career, I was looking to further broaden my horizons. I wanted to get a better exposure to International Commerce, and widen my knowledge of business more generally – across all of its business functions: from Marketing, Human Resource Management, Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, to Advanced Strategic Management &amp; Business Strategy. And even within Finance, new areas that I had previously not had that much exposure to, such as: Venture Capital and Private Equity, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Practical Investments, and Corporate Recovery &amp; Turnaround.</p>

<p>Also, with so many of those close to me in my life, for example, immediate family members, near relatives, and close friends having also done MBAs in their careers, it had become an even stronger aspiration of mine to want to do one, by taking part in a part, or full-time MBA programme. At age 30, with 6.5 years of work experience (since completing my Master’s degree at University, or 7.5, if you include my gap year), I thought why not - 7.5 years into my 42.5 year career, with another full 35 years left, it would be a good time to pursue one!</p>

<p>It would be a great opportunity too, to increase the size and strength of my business network, and chance to get to meet and work with people from very different industries, and professional backgrounds to my own.</p>

<p>At Manchester Business School, where I did my MBA, I think my class alone had 105 people, from over 33 different nationalities, very many of whom had worked in very different industries to mine - from The Royal Air Force, The National Health Service, Human Resourcing, Marketing &amp; Advertising, Law, Management Consultancy, Supply Chain &amp; Logistics, Information Technology, Manufacturing Engineering, Media, Print &amp; Publishing, Oil &amp; Gas, Transportation &amp; Airlines, Private Wealth Management, and Entrepreneurship – pretty much every industry under the sun!</p>

<p>I also felt that doing my MBA would also give me the time to reflect on my career achievements to date, and think about what work I might want to do after my MBA, which, if I’m honest, I found quite difficult to find the time to do, when I was in my full-time job at PwC.</p>

<p>I had some idea of the industry I wanted to work in, or let’s say be closely affiliated with – these were the “Engineering and Technology”, and “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors.</p>

<p>So, I felt I was clear, in my mind, on my “sector-focus”, but was a little unclear on my “role focus” and the kind of role I might want to work in next. So, that was another thing that I felt doing my MBA would help me with.</p>

<p>So, with all these benefits in mind (the challenge of the programme in getting a better exposure to International Commerce; the new knowledge and experiences I would get from working across a range of business functions; the opportunity I would get to meet and learn from new people; the time I would get to reflect on my career achievements to date; and the time I would get to think about the kind of role I felt I might enjoy working in next),…I decided to leave the role I had at PwC, and start a 22-month full-time MBA programme at Manchester Business School, in the U.K.</p>

<p>It’s a very practical, and project-oriented programme, that involves an incredible amount of teamwork, particularly when working across its range of commercial projects, both here in the UK, and Internationally. And in terms of exploring new, and potentially exciting future roles, it gave me the chance to learn more about roles such as: general management, marketing finance, commercial finance, business development, business strategy, corporate finance, and roles in technology that I felt were new and rapidly emerging, that I felt would be really useful future skills to have!</p>

<p><strong>That’s great to hear again Sachin! So, you were looking for a new challenge! You wanted to get a better exposure to international commerce, widen your knowledge and experience of business, across its different functions, meet new people, grow your business network, get some time to reflect about the past, and some time to think about what roles you could work in, in the future - with renewed commitment, confidence, and conviction!</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, you left your first major employer after University, PwC, to go take part in an International Business School programme. Now, having gone through a 2-year full time programme, how do you feel? What do you think those 22 months of experience gave you?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I can very confidently say it gave me a better first-hand exposure to International Commerce, and wider knowledge of Business (across functions such as Marketing, Human Resourcing, Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, Finance, and Advances Strategic Management &amp; Business Strategy).</p>

<p>And this was not just through the classroom teachings, though that was obviously important, as what I had learnt from the classroom were the findings of vast amounts of research carried out by the Business School’s Professors and Academics, from studying 100s of companies, rather than just one case study.</p>

<p>I learnt a lot too from the various Commercial Business Projects I had participated in.</p>

<p>For example, I remember working on quite a range of different Business projects: Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing a “<strong><em>Marketing Plan &amp; Campaign</em></strong>”, for a local chain of nurseries in central Manchester – called “Big Life Nurseries” - to try and raise their across the local community, and increase demand from new customer groups.</li>
  <li>Helping a “<strong><em>National Travel &amp; Hospitality company</em></strong>” - “Netflights” - (now part of the DNATA group) - learn more about the “Sharing Economy” - and of some of the challenges it might face from new entrants into its sector, such as AirBnB - which was fast capturing market share by providing a more authentic holiday stay experience over the traditional providers.</li>
  <li>Writing a “<strong><em>Business Plan</em></strong>” for an idea we felt could help retailers (i) save money in the cost of returned goods, and (ii) better target higher value, higher lifetime customers - through a “unique customer return profile database” that could be used by multiple retailers. Then later, participating in presenting and pitching our business plan to a real life (British) Venture Capitalist.</li>
  <li>Working on an “<strong><em>International Business Project</em></strong>” for a multi-national retailer (across the Middle East), that wanted advice on how it could better manage its “Facilities Management” spend and activities – so it could try and achieve both “cost savings”, and increase “the quality” of its relationships with existing suppliers.</li>
  <li>Other projects I remember working on included, two “<strong><em>Advanced Strategic Management projects</em></strong>”: on the Automotive Engineering company, BMW, and then the Media &amp; Entertainment company, The Walt Disney company, and then one “<strong><em>Corporate Recovery &amp; Turnaround</em></strong>” project on the Video Games and Video Games Console company, The Nintendo company.</li>
</ul>

<p>And asides from the Commercial Business Projects, I got a lot of opportunity too for extra-curricular development - which had instilled in me a much stronger, much healthier attitude, to try to push myself out of my comfort zone and to not be afraid to try new things.</p>

<p>These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signing up to become a member of the business school’s “<strong><em>Banking &amp; Finance</em></strong>” society. Doing that gave me the opportunity to mentor many of those in my class who did not know or have much previous experience: of the <strong><em>Finance</em></strong> sector, or of <strong><em>Finance &amp; Accounting</em></strong> (an area I had gained quite a lot of exposure to, before my MBA)* So, I was able to spend some time coaching many of those in my class on some of the important concepts and principles of <strong><em>Finance &amp; Accounting</em></strong>, and also take more of a leading role in many of the group assignments we did, for example in: <strong><em>Economics</em></strong>, <strong><em>Venture Capital</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Corporate Finance</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Then, signing up to become a member of the business school’s “<strong><em>Consulting Club</em></strong>”, to help many of my classmates who wanted to get summer internships or full-time offers with consulting companies, by helping them practice through “consulting case studies” ahead of any interviews, which I already had some earlier experience in.</li>
  <li>Then, participating in a “<strong><em>European Private Equity Case Competition</em></strong>”, in an inter-MBA business school case competition that was held in Amsterdam, where in a small team representing my Business School, I was able to help advise a small Dutch Investment Fund on the different ways it could structure a new investment into a Solar Energy Power Project, in Southern Africa.</li>
  <li>Then, playing in my Business School’s “<strong><em>Table Tennis</em></strong>” team, and competing in the Annual European Sports Tournament, MBAT, that was held in France - a sports tournament that was attended by all the other leading business schools across Europe.</li>
  <li>And then finally, in whatever time I had left, helping organise and participate in different <strong><em>social events</em></strong> and <strong><em>evenings</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for me, there were just so many strands of <strong><em>personal development</em></strong>, <strong><em>communication</em></strong>, and <strong><em>leadership</em></strong>, that I got from doing my MBA, that just by being in that kind of environment, working with a lot of smart and motivated people, every day, for two years, it was just that “<strong><em>hive of activity</em></strong>”, working for some very Senior Business Leaders across different Industries, and with Senior Academic Professors - that was one of my biggest takeaways from my MBA.</p>

<p>And with these experiences, I was also able to learn new skills. I don’t think it is possible to list all of the skills I learnt, right here, right now, but here are a few that I felt I was able to work on, and improve, to varying degrees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My Management and Leadership skills of teams and colleagues.</li>
  <li>My Problem Solving, Reasoning, and Creativity skills</li>
  <li>My International Outlook of the world, Team Orientation, and ability to work in International Teams</li>
  <li>My ability to share my experiences and express my ideas to other groups of people, both written, verbally, or through presentations</li>
  <li>My Client Relationship Management skills</li>
  <li>My Financial and Budgetary responsibility skills</li>
  <li>My Decision-Making skills</li>
  <li>My Contributory skills to Business Strategy</li>
  <li>My Analytical, Numeracy, and Negotiation skills</li>
  <li>My ability to Generate New Ideas.</li>
  <li>My ability to work with some very bright, very motivated, and enthusiastic people, each with a strong sense of personal values, community involvement, and work integrity</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, I think, other people in their careers, may think that they’re already very successful, or very experienced, and or well-educated, or may feel like they are already learning quite a lot, and so will just stay where there are. That may be true! And that’s fine, there is nothing wrong with that! You could end up being a Partner of Tax at a Professional Services firm – if that is something that is what you want to do over the long term, and believe will always get you up in the morning, something you are so truly passionate about, that you are going to continue to have the guts and conviction to pursue that for the rest of your career..</p>

<p>For me, I think that by going on to a 2 year MBA programme (compared to something else), you are just likely to learn from more people, with a much greater <strong><em>perspective</em></strong> and <strong><em>diversity</em></strong> of experiences – who are all there, because they want to help each other - both as citizens of society and leaders of the business world!</p>

<p><strong>Well it sounds like you had an incredible time Sachin! You did and learnt a wide variety of new things - as you say, not just from your classroom professors, and case studies, but also from the commercial business projects you took part in, the colleagues you worked with, and all the extracurricular activities you were able to get involved with.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, as you approached the end of the programme, and as the time came to start thinking about what you might want to do next, what different pathways or roles did you start to consider? I imagine you must have been thinking about quite a few options, given all the new skills, knowledge, and materials you must have built-up over those two years.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, that’s right. I had been considering a few different pathways or roles. Specifically, roles in: general management, commercial finance, marketing finance, corporate finance, business development, advanced strategic management &amp; business strategy, but also technology roles, in areas that I felt were new and rapidly emerging.</p>

<p>After all that experience, I just wanted to be able do something where I could use what I had learnt in “Technology, Engineering, and Operations” Management from my Engineering Degree; what I had learnt about in “Finance &amp; Accountancy” when I had worked at PwC; and then the broad range of knowledge, and skills I had built-up over my MBA.</p>

<p>I knew the two sectors that interested me the most were the “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>”, or “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sectors – so I was looking for companies that designed and built new and creative things.</p>

<h2 id="freelancing---data--technology">Freelancing - Data &amp; Technology</h2>

<p><strong>So, after your MBA, from the pathways and roles you were considering, I see, eventually, you ended up starting your own company - providing “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Data Analytics” solutions. Are you able to tell us a little bit more about how you ended up going down this path?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, well, both during and immediately after my MBA, I had been considering different roles, as I said, in: general management, commercial finance, marketing finance, advanced strategic management &amp; business strategy, business development, and corporate finance, and new and rapidly emerging areas in technology.</p>

<p>For me, nothing much was biting in the market. That the UK Economy was affected by Brexit, in April / May 2016 didn’t help with finding paid work, as quite a few companies (in the U.K.) had retrenched their hiring activities, particularly for those at my level (MBA level). And I was quite selective too, as I already knew the two sectors that I wanted to work in.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, over this time as I was directly applying to companies, I had also started to learn more about this area called: “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” - it was a new area for me!</p>

<p>Towards the end of my MBA, over our 3-month International Business Project, I had been working in the Middle East for a multi-national retailer out there. That was the first time I had learnt about this new “<strong><em>Advanced Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” tool, called “<em>Tableau</em>” - something that had been developed by some Computer Science Researchers at Stanford University.</p>

<p>I had never really heard about “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” before. But after investing some time to learn more about it, and then using it successfully to provide our Middle Eastern client with new insights into the data our team had collected, (much more quickly than we could have done using any other tool we knew of at that time), the retailer’s Group CFO, on seeing our final written report and presentation, was really impressed. He had never seen anything like it and gave me and my team incredible feedback!</p>

<p>Given how well that project had gone, I got a lot of encouragement from relatives, friends, and MBA work colleagues, to explore further, and learn more about the area of “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>”.</p>

<p>I was also personally really quite curious!</p>

<p>I saw it as a high growth area - something that a lot of companies in the future would need people with well-developed skills and expertise in. I knew too that with significant advances being made in adjacent fields such as “<strong><em>Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence</em></strong>” – that demand for modern data analytics tools, to help companies keep pace with their own growing data needs, would also only increase!</p>

<p>So, after realising this, and after the encouragement I got, after my MBA, my pathways became: general management, commercial finance, marketing finance, advanced strategic management &amp; business strategy, business development, corporate finance, but also, because of this newly founded fascination, “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>”.</p>

<p>After my MBA, I was at home a lot (at my Parent’s house), so decided instead of being dictated by the whims and fancies of companies that I had been trying to find paid work at, in the U.K., set up my own company, which was a learning experience in itself.</p>

<p>This involved initially, spending quite some time, creating my own website to establish an online presence – and then looking for work, connecting with people, Senior Business People, anywhere in the world, where I could start applying my new skills.</p>

<p>As I was creating my website, I had also invested a lot of personal time, to learn and sharpen my skills in “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>”, and the different Business Intelligence softwares I knew about in the market at that time, such as: “<em>Tableau</em>” and “<em>Power BI</em>”, and different software languages like DAX, and M-code, needed to create and develop solutions with them.</p>

<p>I also took some steps, to develop my own <strong><em>Data Management</em></strong> and <strong><em>Data Reporting</em></strong> skills, by reading through relevant books and blog articles that I found on the topic, (for example, “<strong><em>The Definitive Guide to DAX</em></strong>” by Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari, taught me about some of the fundamental principles of database design; Then the book, “<strong><em>‘M’ is for Data Monkey</em></strong>” by Ken Plus, taught me about different ETL techniques that can be used to “extract”, “clean”, “transform”, and “load” data.</p>

<p>In some other extra time I had, I thought about learning more about “<strong><em>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</em></strong>”, but also “<strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong>”, might also be a useful future skill to have. So I read through this book called “<strong><em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</em></strong>” by Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, to learn more about Machine Learning (basic things such as what test data, training data, classification algorithms, and regression algorithms, etc. were). Then also learning more about the software language ‘R’ that was used to solve Machine Learning kind of problems.</p>

<p>Then, with the company set up, both “<strong><em>online</em></strong>” (through its website), and “<strong><em>offline</em></strong>” (through me, my computer, and my desk), I began the hard work of trying to find customers, in either of the “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>”, or “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sectors - any team, anywhere in the world, that needed or might be interested in employing “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” solutions to their own current business problems.</p>

<p>So this is all how it kind of started.</p>

<h2 id="industry---jaguar-land-rover">Industry - Jaguar Land Rover</h2>

<p><strong>Thanks for explaining that transition Sachin, that was very clear! So, after you had done all the hard work of researching and learning more about “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” and developing your skills in that area, how did you go about trying to find customers? How did you find that? Did you see an increase in demand from companies, for people with such skills?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I did. An increase in both awareness, interest, demand and action. Finding customers, initially, I would say was definitely quite challenging. It was an area I was still learning more about, and my networks with people, in the field, in the two sectors I wanted to work in, weren’t so strong, especially given the economic situation at the time.</p>

<p>Then one day, after having approached them, I remember talking to the Head of the Product Finance department at Jaguar Land Rover. He was trying to manage a team that were responsible for recording and reporting on the cost (actual cost standard cost, etc.), but also location, and condition of cars still under Jaguar Land Rover’s ownership across the U.K. (those cars that had been made by the company and its Engineers, but which hadn’t yet been sold, and were still part the company’s inventory.)</p>

<p>His team had been having problems with getting and recording some information from the company’s own internal manufacturing, and finance &amp; accounting systems - which had been causing some delays in reporting to the company’s stakeholders: e.g. to the Group CFO and his immediate team, to the company’s parent company, The Tata Group, and then to the company’s external Auditors, Deloitte - who had a small team in their office at the time, to do their usual Audit checks.</p>

<p>As I didn’t have much else on, that was giving me a paid income, they had invited me to work for them for 3 months starting about a month and a half before their financial year-end! So, I had accepted their invitation. When I started, the company’s year-end was also only a month away, and they were under a lot of pressure to deliver this information to meet some of their internal deadlines, so I had to hit the ground running, so to speak.</p>

<p>When I started, my own interpretation of the situation was that some of department’s processes were not working all that well, or just not working at all. Some of the documentation they had, I didn’t think was all that good – much of it, was either just completely absent, or some it, was a few years (e.g. 3-4 years) out of date.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to add to some of the difficulties they were already having, the handover I had, from the earlier person - wasn’t all that neat either. And the relationships between some of the team members across the desks in the company’s Product Finance team and company’s external Auditors was not that great (In fact, I think the following year, they had decided to change their external Auditors from Deloitte, to KPMG).</p>

<p>So, when I started, I just took the steps to try and sort out the situation there, in a way I best knew how. That, initially, took me the good part of a whole month. Then, once things had settled down, I could focus on introducing my team to things such as “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics”. That is when I had introduced and started selling to them the idea of using “Tableau”, and about how much better it would be over what the department was currently using, to produce the kind of reports they needed. So, that gave me two further months of work. I guess you could say that for the work experience I got with Jaguar Land Rover, I got my first breakthrough, in that, after my MBA, they were my first main paying customer!</p>

<p>Then, after working there, I started to look for my next customer, to try and basically sustain an income, with my next potential customer.</p>

<p>A few months after I had finished working at Jaguar Land Rover, in the Christmas of 2007, I then got a call from the Group CFO of the multi-national retailer, in the Middle East, who I had worked for at the end of my MBA. Over the phone, he asked me whether I would be interested in doing some “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” work for them, back at their offices in Dubai for a few weeks. As I wasn’t working with any customers here in the UK, and was interested in learning more about “Power BI”, (at this point I only knew about “Tableau”),  which was the “Advanced Visual Data Analytics” tool they were using there, I accepted his invitation, and flew out to the Middle East to work with one of the Head of their company’s “In-House Procurement” department.</p>

<p>Then, after successfully delivering the work for his “In-House Procurement” team, because of the relationships he had with people in other companies (mostly CEOs and CFOs in other multi-national retail companies, in the region), he then introduced me to other people he thought might also need some help with employing the kinds of “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” skills, I had been developing. So, when I was out there, I was able to work for a few more companies – in this case, retailers such as: “Majid Al Futtaim”, “Carrefour”, and, then also a medium-sized, but also multi-national printing-packaging company. And so that’s when I was able to get, what you might say, my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th customers.</p>

<p>I was quite a nice short spell. Being in the same place (the Middle East), for a few weeks, working for such a close cluster of companies. It was something that I actually really enjoyed. Outside work, I got to travel abroad for a few weeks, meet new people, and visit some of the region’s local tourist sights and attractions. I was able to learn a bit more too about the city’s (Abu Dhabi’s and Dubai’s) culture and history, as I continued to develop and further advance my skills in area of: “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics”.</p>

<p>From the extra experience I got from working there, it raised my own profile in the market, and had established some extra trust and credibility in the kind of working I was doing. It had also probably made others more aware of the kind of work that I did as a freelancer.</p>

<p>In fact, I should say that before I started working at Jaguar Land Rover, that in December 2016 and January 2017, I was also able to visit a medium-sized District Eye Hospital, in Northern India, as they needed someone who could integrate “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” tools for them - to improve the way they reported on the performance of their different Hospital Units – so they could, for example, more clearly see which Hospital units were growing quickly, and which units were in need of further investment. I had worked for them for a few weeks.</p>

<p>But going back to your original question, how did I find, finding new customers? Well, initially, quite challenging. It wasn’t easy, that’s something I keep telling myself. But gradually, through the people I knew, and relationships I had developed and cultivated, I got one or two lucky breakthroughs, and momentum gradually picked up.</p>

<p><strong>Well, it sounds like, although you had struggled somewhat initially to find new customers, given you were still developing your skills in this area, and still trying to grow your networks – that after some time, you got one or two lucky breakthroughs: initially, at Jaguar Land Rover, in the UK, to help them overcome some internal data reporting issues; then later, at a collection of retailers, in the Middle East, on some of the data projects they needed your help with; and then also, I should not forget, a District Eye Hospital, in Northern India, to help them implement better reporting solutions, across their Hospital.</strong></p>

<h2 id="industry---wpp">Industry - WPP</h2>

<p><strong>What about back here, in the United Kingdom? Can you tell us a little about that? How did finding customers here, in the UK, go, after Jaguar Land Rover?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I would say that things here were somewhat slow to begin with. For example, after working for Jaguar Land Rover, in their Product Finance Department, I had quite a quiet patch. I had tried looking for new customers through the usual routes. For example, (i) online, on the internet, applying directly through company websites (ii) by looking at what vacancies recruitment agencies that helped people find work, had posted on their websites, and applying to and calling them.</p>

<p>I tried that for some time, but it wasn’t really getting much success. You know, I would hit the usual barriers: a lot of unanswered calls and emails. When that started happening, it started to leave me with the impression that maybe there was no interest from companies for people these new kinds of skills. But I didn’t believe it, as there were still job adverts appearing for this kind of work.</p>

<p>I remained tenacious and persevered! I had started exploring “more unorthodox” routes. As a bit of a gamble, I decided to send out an “offer of assistance” letter, to all the CEOs and all the CFOs of all the companies where, I thought there might be a genuine interest in this kind of work - because I knew, abroad at least, and had found more success, that interest and demand had been growing!</p>

<p>I must have sent 23 “offer of assistance” letters to about 23 different companies. These included: Virgin, Sky, Pinewood, Warner Bros, Universal, Paramount, and Apple amongst those in the “Media &amp; Entertainment” sector. Then Sony, Honda, Toyota, Panasonic, Canon, BMW, Nissan, Dyson, Lamborghini, McLaren, Phillips, and Bose, amongst those in the “Engineering &amp; Technology” sector, as well as few smaller businesses close to where I lived, in my parent’s home town.</p>

<p>For some reason, and I don’t know why, I got <strong>one</strong> reply only, and that was from the Marketing &amp; Advertising company, WPP. My letter had somehow found its way to the Head of Human Resourcing of EMEA, who had forwarded my CV to various CEOs and CFOs across the company. That is when the U.K CFO of one of their digital CRM and E-commerce agencies, Wunderman (Thompson), had seen my CV, and wanted to meet with me to learn more about me, the skills I had developed, kind of work I had been doing.</p>

<p>When I did some online web research to learn more about what Wunderman Thompson did, I didn’t mind what the agency did. Even though they were not what I might traditionally consider as a “Media &amp; Technology” agency, I saw a lot of overlap between what the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” and “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors did, in terms of “Multi-Media”, “Video-Making”, and “Creativity”, and so on. So, the company appealed to me!</p>

<p>So, the CFO called me to his offices. We had a good discussion, he talked about what he was looking to do, and the kind of reports he needed help with producing, and I then talked about my experiences, and the kind of work I had recently been doing. There was a strong mutual synergy!</p>

<p>Then a day or two later, I made another day trip to London, which is when I got to meet with one of the agency’s Managing Director’s, and we got talking. And it wasn’t long after that, they had extended an offer to work for them at their main offices in Greater House London, near Mornington Crescent, in London, initially on a 3-month contract.</p>

<p><strong>That’s really great Sachin! So, after working for some retailers, in the Middle East, you must have been delighted to have eventually secured some work back here in the UK! Obviously, the HR person you connected with, at WPP, when she saw your initial ‘offer of assistance’ letter and CV, and then later, the other people you met, they must have had a huge belief in your ability! How important do you think that is - the people and relationship aspect? – that ability to connect with people - those you gradually get to know obviously? How important do you think that is compared to some of the more formal degrees, and formal qualifications you may have acquired over your career so far?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s hard to differentiate between the two. Every moment is an opportunity to do something right, and to get some experience, and then to learn from those experiences.</p>

<p>I’m sure the opportunity to work at WPP wouldn’t have come about, if I hadn’t had all the experiences, degrees, and qualifications I had gained up to that point. They probably liked the cross-functional experiences I had gotten from my MBA, and then CA experiences I had gotten from PwC. Without that, I don’t think the meeting at WPP would have happened.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is, and it has probably become even stronger since – (working where I have, with the various people I have, over the years), – is that a strong appreciation of technology, followed by some formal training in finance, and accounting, followed by a broad and challenging business programme, like an MBA, if properly applied, are three of the best preparations you can have for a career in the commercial and business world.</p>

<p>I think many companies in the business world today, rely and operate very heavily on technology, and on the idea of having to follow some very black and white rules. But there are some situations, where it is just unrealistic to follow very black and white rules - and always have to stick to them. In these situations, you just need to know where the grey areas are, and where the red lines are, and how far you can push things!</p>

<p>It is ok to be comfortable in the grey area, if you know where those are. You just have to be aware to not cross those red lines! But, if you know where those grey areas are, and have that ability to see things in a different way, that is where you can explore new commercial opportunities - these are the real opportunities, that usually lie, at the very margins.</p>

<p>At Wunderman, when I started, I recognised that I could really add value by exploring those areas, where perhaps some of their existing people were reluctant to go, or didn’t quite understand the nuances of, or didn’t have the skills to apply relatively new technologies in new and different ways.</p>

<p>I think I was only able to do what I did, very successfully, at Wunderman, because of the degrees, qualifications, experiences, and interests, I had built up over my past life and career: both during and before I did my MBA; during and before I worked at PwC; during and before I read Engineering at University; and when I went to Primary and Secondary School.</p>

<p>But then, I also think that asides from the degrees, qualifications and earlier experiences, that a lot must have also come down to who I was as a person and individual. I think the people I had met, and worked with at WPP, the CFO, MD, CTalentO, etc., they had identified in me someone they felt could fit well within the Wunderman agency, and WPP Group - that it would be a place where I would be welcomed, and could just get down to my work, and really thrive and flourish!</p>

<p>Personality would have been an important consideration. In that sense, you are always reliant on that in any job situation. In the interviews, the people I met were probably quite impressed by what I had to say, and obviously, they thought, that I would do well in the work they gave me.</p>

<p>I also think that much of the decision to hire me was probably down to the situation that WPP, and the Marketing &amp; Advertising Industry, more generally, was in at the time - facing strong pressures from the Technology Industry – from companies such as Facebook, and Google.</p>

<p>Though the marketing spend and budgets of companies has not been falling (spend as a percentage of total revenue has remained the same for many companies for quite a few years) – where companies have been spending their marketing spend, has been changing quite rapidly, shifting more and more towards online channels of ad spend (such as programmatic advertising), which WPPs existing agency network model had been struggling and slow to adapt to.</p>

<p>Specifically, in WPP’s case, there had been a big change in the company’s leadership, with the leaving / departure of Martin Sorrel, under quite controversial circumstances, and then appointment of Mark Read. Mark had actually been the CEO of Wunderman, the agency I was invited to work at, before moving on to his new role, as Group CEO of the WPP Group.</p>

<p>The company had gone through several changes when I was there: it decided to restate its brand identity, vision and values. Given how both complex and complicated the business had become, globally for its customers, they took several steps to further simplify it. For example, they decided to merge J. Walter Thompson, the world’s then oldest ad agency, with Wunderman, their digital e-commerce agency to create a new agency called Wunderman Thompson. I read in the news somewhere too that they had merged VML, their digital advertising agency, with Young &amp; Rubicam, another one of their advertising agencies. As further changes, they had also started co-locating agencies into the same Campus Buildings in some of their European Offices.</p>

<p>So, going back to your original question, the opportunity to work for them, I would say came about because of a combination of factors - an “alignment of the stars and planets!” - so to speak, if you believe in all that good Karma, Greater Power kind of stuff!</p>

<p>It came down to: my earlier degrees, qualifications, and experiences; how they saw me as a person; how they felt I might fit within the culture of a “Marketing &amp; Advertising” company, such as WPP; then also because of what was actually happening in the company and industry at the time - they needed someone with a very specific set of skills - who could pick up the work they wanted to do, very quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, there was also some luck in it too! My CV actually being read by the right person, at the right time, and then, the initiative that was taken by their CFO and MD to invite, meet and talk with me in the first place!</p>

<p><strong>That sounds really interesting Sachin – so quite a multitude of different factors led to the appointment at WPP, but, I guess, it all started with you trying a slightly different, “unorthodox approach”, of sending out direct “offer of assistance” letters to some very Senior Business People at companies, across the “Engineering &amp; Technology”, and “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors in the UK - when before you had initially tried other routes and channels that just didn’t work! Before you started, did you know much about WPP? What was it like working for them? How long did you work there for?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” wasn’t an industry I knew “as well” as the “Engineering Technology”, or “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors. I probably wasn’t going to work / meet with people who worked in a Special FX studio, or bump into Film Directors, at WPP, and it wasn’t going to be quite like an MIT Media Lab, or experimental Google / Alphabet labs kind of a place. But I did know that it was quite a well-known company in the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” industry – both here in the U.K., and Internationally – alongside other companies industry names, such as, Dentsu, in Japan, Publicis, in France, and Omnicom, in the United States.</p>

<p><em>How was it like working there?</em></p>

<p>Well, I had a really good time. My immediate team were wonderful, very warm and welcoming, very multi-cultural, very international, and I grew to admire the culture of the agency at Wunderman. That’s one thing I thought they did very well at Wunderman.</p>

<p>Thinking about my team alone and where the people were from: there was one person of South African descent, one person of Australian descent, two of British descent, one of Pakistani descent, two of Indian descent (if you include me), and another of Nigerian descent. Then in the team that sat to my right of my team, there was one person from Brazil, two from Spain, one from India, one from Zambia, one from Finland, one from Hungary, one from France, another from Russia, and two or three people from Italy. So, it was very diverse!</p>

<p>WPP’s Wunderman agency was one of the first places I had worked at, where, after a very long time, I felt I could really be myself. It was very different to the very formal experiences I had at PwC. At WPP, you didn’t always have to show yourself to be a super formal “corporate” citizen, and wear a buttoned-up suit, jacket and tie, every day. I learnt that that kind of thing doesn’t quite work in the Marketing &amp; Advertising industry – though I’ll admit, not having to wear a suit and tie every day did take some getting used to!</p>

<p>The Agency’s authenticity was also something I really liked. In organisations where there is that authenticity, you give yourself a much better chance of just being able to be yourself and do well! And, it felt great, after a very long time to have a permanent desk! Having a permanent desk gets more and important as you get older - so that was something else I enjoyed, not having to “hot desk”!</p>

<p>The work itself was quite tough and challenging. I constantly felt like I was being pushed, by my peers, outside of my comfort zone. I was encouraged too, to give my own suggestions and contribute my own ideas to some of the data reporting problems they needed help with. This is something I am very grateful to my immediate team, for allowing me to do.</p>

<p>Then, after working with the UK CFO, and in his team for 3 months, the European MD who interviewed me, before I started, asked me if I wanted to do similar kind of work for their Global CFO, and team. I saw it as a great opportunity to further apply my “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” skills to new problems, and again thought why not – it would open me up to new learning and development opportunities.</p>

<p>And so, that’s when I got to start working with some of their colleagues in their Los Angeles office. In fact, the MD was so impressed with me, and the work I was doing, that he increased my daily pay rate, to what he felt was a much fairer rate for the quality of work I was doing So, that made me feel really good, especially as it was something he did, without me really asking! I’ll never forget that!</p>

<p>If you want to look and think about things in terms of size: though Wunderman was not as big as some of the companies I had worked at before (in terms of no. of staff, and size of revenue), as say those in “The Investment Management Group” division, in the “Business Assurance” department, at PwC, or some of the “Retail” companies I had worked for in the Middle East, or even “Jaguar Land Rover”, here in the UK, they (Wunderman Thompson) are still no small agency! They employed 10,000 to 12,000 people, and had a wide global footprint, with a well-connected network of international offices (Double that, following the merger with JWT). So, I definitely felt like I was able to make some very important contributions.</p>

<p>Then, after working for the Global Commercial team at Wunderman, my work at WPP continued. They invited me to stay working for them, for another 10 to 11 months, and I eventually ended up working for 3 to 4 other agencies across the Group!</p>

<p><strong>Well, Sachin, I can definitely tell you got a lot of enjoyment working WPP! Not many people, I imagine, would be able to say that they got to work for 4 to 5 different agencies, at the same company, within the space of just 13-14 months. What do you think made you different in the eyes of the people around you, the MDs, CFOs, CTalentOs, and CEOs you worked with?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I think the fact that I got to work several agencies, was partly to do with the fact that I was working more independently, so had more of a “freer hand”, and greater freedom to move around, to do the kind of things that I felt could be further improved. As a consequence, because I really liked what I was doing, and the different problems I was being asked to solve, I gradually became much better. And the people around me started to really appreciate my work.</p>

<p>I think, the MD I had been working with, a month or two after I had started, started to see in me the various things he felt I could bring to the agency, and the WPP Group as a whole. For example, the understanding I had gained in “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>” from University; the grounding I had gained in “<strong><em>Finance &amp; Accountancy</em></strong>” at PwC; the broader “<strong><em>Business Functional</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>International Commerce</em></strong>” experiences I had gained from my MBA, to then also, the more recent <strong><em>Entrepreneurial</em></strong>” experiences I had gained from running my own company – along with the continued interest I maintained in the “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>”, and “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sectors. I think he saw ALL of that as a really unique and powerful combination.</p>

<p>After I had finished working for Wunderman’s Global Finance Team, he then asked whether I wanted to do some work for Wunderman’s Human Resourcing department, as they needed some help with some HR data problems. I saw it as an opportunity to solve more problems, but this time in a different business function. I also felt it would allow me to apply some of the things I had learnt from the “Human Resource Management” classes I took from my MBA.</p>

<p>So, I said “Yes”, which is when I got to work in a very different business function, in Wunderman’s UK Human Resourcing department, for a month or two - working with two or three of their Chief Talent Officers, to help resolve some issues they were having, in trying to build up some new HR reporting capabilities.</p>

<p>Then, after helping out there, the same MD asked me whether I could help with a project they were thinking of doing at their agency, “Geometry” - a new initiative they were looking to try and implement, to better report on a new Global Budgeting tool they were trying to create. They were looking for someone with my kind of skills and background, but also someone who had worked for some months in one of the other agencies within the WPP Group.</p>

<p>I saw no reason not to say “Yes”, and so, started working for their agency “Geometry”. In fact, it was on that project that I also got to work with a person who had previously been an MD of Geometry, who later went on to become the “Global Head of  A.I. and Data” at the WPP Group (That’s the title at least)! (So, I’m really happy for her!)</p>

<p>Then, after successfully completing this data project at Geometry, I was invited back by the same Wunderman MD, to work for the Wunderman EMEA team, for their European CFO, to help build-out and improve certain aspects of their European Group-wide Finance Function.</p>

<p>For some areas I had been asked to work on, they sometimes wanted to create something completely new (as they didn’t have the reports, processes, or systems in place). So, I basically, had to try and create and build these from scratch. So, that was another interesting challenge, and something I really enjoyed, which I was able to learn a lot from.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I got to work on another project with Wunderman’s EMEA level Human Resourcing department, to help build-out some new Gender Pay Gap reports – something new, that the agency wanted to start reporting on, as it had also become a new legal requirement.</p>

<p>At this time, a few months later, the agency had also announced that they were going to merge with JWT, and that another 12,000 employees would be joining the business. This made me think even more of just how important the work I was doing was, and contributions I was making. Wunderman had also over those months called in some external contractors, to completely redesign, and re-furbish their workspaces and floor space. So that was also something that was going on.</p>

<p>The one last thing I would add to this question is that it is still important to recognise that WPP is still a meritocracy. There are no clearly demarcated lines; and it is not the kind of place where you sit in a cubicle and do the same one thing over and over again. There, I found, that if are willing to roll up your sleeves, and have a go at something, then it had the environment and support network, (at least I felt), to ensure you were able to do just that. And, if you did well, you were encouraged to do that work again, and again, and again, coming up with new solutions to slightly different kinds of problems. And, in my case, I ended up working there for about 13-14 months.</p>

<p><strong>Really great Sachin! When looking back, over that period, I’m sure there is so much others could learn from the way you started and worked with their agencies. You obviously got on well with the people there, and they seemed mightily impressed with the work you were doing! Was that the case at all the agencies? From all of your experiences, what would you say is one of the single most important things you did, that allowed you to work on such a diverse range of projects?</strong></p>

<p><em>Very good question!</em></p>

<p>I’d say, initially, when I started, it was all about my ability to do what I said I could, and would do: to quickly and clearly demonstrate to the team what I had learnt in the area of “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” and to demonstrate to them, how I could apply these skills to solve the kinds of data problems they were having.</p>

<p>It was also about showing to them what my knowledge and skills in “Finance &amp; Accountancy” were like, and how I was able to effectively use and apply the materials and learnings from my MBA, across the agencies’ wider business functions: in the case of WPP, this meant to their “Human Resource Management” department, as one of the business functions I worked in, but also “Marketing”, as the company itself operated in the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” sector.</p>

<p>After that, once I had established a basic level of trust, credibility and competence, it was then just all about building relationships. Everyone, I believe, in these kinds of companies, works hard. You can take that as a given! Everyone is very smart, and business savvy! You can take that as a given! But then, what becomes really important is the ability to build relationships and do this in an emotionally intelligent, and empathetic way. So, soft skills are crucial.</p>

<p>If you can try to do all these things, and then create a network of people you can call upon, whenever you need to, and bring all their resources to bear, in any situation, that might call for it, then, I’d say you’d do very well! For me, that was the key determinant of the success I had when at Wunderman (Thompson).</p>

<p>I will say, one thing though - it won’t work all the time – sometimes you find yourself in a situation, where things are just out of your control. For example, I personally had a really amazing time at WPPs agencies, “Wunderman / JWT”, “Possible”, and “Geometry”, but not such a nice experience at their agency “Hogarth”. Though I was only there for a short time, I didn’t feel the culture was as nice as Wunderman’s (no group late afternoon Friday pub lunches, or Friday floor announcements), and, I also didn’t think that some of the departments at Hogarth were as well organised, or were tackling some of the agency’s issues in the right way, or doing this as well as some of the other senior people were across the Group’s other agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Well Sachin. Thank you for sharing this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I think the key lessons I take from this are: demonstrating your abilities and competencies to do what you said you could and would do; the importance of establishing and maintaining strong relationships with the people you work with; and then, of how important company and agency culture can be, in for example, how it can affect employee morale, employee engagement, productivity, and effectiveness – which at the end of the day, all links back to the Customer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I know you probably can’t say too much about the kind of work you did, but are you able to tell us a little bit about how the demand for the “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” reports you had to create at WPP, changed or increased?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I think everyone, in every organisation, relies on having complete and accurate reports – whether it is their Finance function, their Human Resources function, their Procurement function, their Business Strategy / Advanced Strategic Management function, or their Marketing function. You need these reports, to be able to effectively operate as a business. They give the information that is needed for the business to make both their long-term “strategic”, and daily “operational” decisions.</p>

<p>In my case, at Wunderman Thompson, in WPP, initially, there was a desire for some basic reporting systems, using the tools I knew of, to make sure that their reporting systems were complete, accurate, robust, easy to review and update That initial desire then later grew into a desire to produce more sophisticated, more complex reports, that gave more detailed, but still, relevant business information.</p>

<p>For the Wunderman UK team, working for the UK CFO, for example – the reports were mostly about what revenue they were getting from different clients. But then, when I worked for Wunderman Global, for their Global CFO and team – the reports were about showing this, but also about showing how the levels of working capital, varied across different clients.</p>

<p>Other reports I had created, for other business functions, for example in their Human Resourcing department, were built-up in a similar way: - I started out with some basic reports, and then these became more sophisticated and complex, with time, with each iteration.</p>

<p>Over the 3 years I have been doing this kind of work, I can definitely say that more and more companies are now starting to much more soundly appreciate the kinds of data problems that “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” tools can solve for their businesses. They appreciate too how well these tools can provide the kinds of managerial insights that say, older tools, like Excel, or PowerPoint used to be able to provide - but in a much quicker, more secure way. And, in my case, I’ve seen an interest from across the spectrum – from CAdminOs, CFOs, MDs, CTalentOs, Business Owners, CEOs, COOs, and Heads of Commercial Finance departments.</p>

<p>And it’s not just demand for “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” solutions either – there has been a lot of growth in other areas related to it - in the overall field of “Data &amp; Technology”. I don’t know the names all of these technologies (there are too many for just one person to learn in one lifetime!), but one area I do know of, where there has been steep growth, has been in: “Data Warehousing”, and “Cloud Computing” services – particularly those offered by Technology providers such as Microsoft, on its Azure Technology platform, and Amazon with Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic Sachin! So, you saw an increase in demand: from some basic reports, to then slightly more sophisticated reports, across quite a range of different business functions!</strong></p>

<h2 id="industry---diageo">Industry - Diageo</h2>

<p><strong>So then, after WPP, where you seemed to have got your second lucky breakthrough in the U.K., when looking for paid work, what did you do next? How did you go about finding your next customer? Because I can imagine, working through your own company, as an independent freelancer, that is something you constantly have to also think about, and work on?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yes that’s definitely true, one of the joys, but also drawbacks of independent freelancing, or working through a one-man start-up!</p>

<p>Well, after work had finished, I did the obvious thing, and asked the people I knew and had worked with at WPP, whether they needed any further help, or had any business projects or initiatives I could help with. Unfortunately, as the summer had just started, I was told it might be difficult to find work, but the MDs and CFOs I had been in touch with, said they would be on the lookout!</p>

<p>After that, I just tried to find work, from other people I knew in my business and family networks. That is when an MBA friend of mine, who worked in one of the “Technology &amp; Innovation” departments at Diageo, (who now works in “Strategic Tech” partnerships at Google) had asked whether I could help out with doing some work for one of Diageo’s smaller “Corporate Venture Funds”. The Fund had started investing in several drinks start-ups and had been struggling to gather the data they needed, quickly enough, to prepare the reports they wanted to see, to monitor how well their portfolio investments were doing.</p>

<p>I gave some initial thoughts and ideas, after having better understood their business data problem, then discussed and went through a solution with my MBA friend. After that, he then introduced me to various people at the VC Fund, and that’s how I got to start doing work for them and their team. Their team liked some of my advice and recommendations, and some of the reports I had started producing for them. And, I was able to work for them part-time, for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Though the Corporate Venture Fund was obviously a different scale altogether from WPP, the work itself was no less difficult, and no less challenging! I would even go to say that some of the things I had been asked to do for them, in terms of some of the reports they wanted me to create, were conceptually more complex, and more challenging.</p>

<p>I would say, it is also important to recognise that they are both very different kinds of businesses, in terms of size, stages of growth, and business situations they were going through. WPP, as a large listed FTSE 100 company, had its own challenges (when I was there – going through a period of significant restructuring: e.g. merging of some of its agencies, and simplification of its business).</p>

<p>Then, with the Corporate Venture Fund, the challenge had been in trying to sustain and keep up with a very high rate of growth, whilst still trying to maintain the quality of that growth (e.g. to make sure that any uncontrolled expansion did not lead to a wastage of company time, money, or resources – where, for example, operational processes did not flow smoothly – that might lead to staff being spread too thinly, or employees and management trying to cut corners, to meet customer demand) So far, with the feedback I’ve been getting, things have been going well for that VC Fund. They liked the reports I created for them, and so I am happy that things are going well for them!</p>

<h2 id="other-questions">Other Questions</h2>

<p><strong>That’s an incredible transition Sachin! Working for one of largest Marketing &amp; Advertising companies in the world, helping them overcome some internal problems, in an industry facing its own challenges, all the way to then working for a small, very entrepreneurial, but rapidly growing, Corporate Venture Fund. I’m sure from your experiences, you’ve come to realise the importance of business networking, and how critical that is! What advice would you give to our readers when it comes to trying to establish a strong, and over time, successful business network?</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I would say, when it comes to networking, is do it smartly, because early on, it can be challenging! All those questions that you need to be able to answer, such as where and how do you start? I think, whatever kind of temperament or disposition you, as an individual, might have, if you’re starting something new, the early days are always going to be tough! – (unless you happen to be incredibly lucky, which people seldom are - so you have to do the hard work of creating your own luck!)</p>

<p>So, my first piece of advice would be to - try to be organised and efficient about who you approach, and then how you approach them, to make sure your efforts are effective, and don’t go to waste. For example, applying to the same 3 recruitment agencies, by email – that you never get a reply from, means the agency is either not interested, hasn’t had a chance to reply (they might be under-resourced), or that you’re one of those unlucky ones whose CV always ends up being put at the back of the queue. (That might just be a luck thing, or an unconscious bias thing).</p>

<p>If you do the same thing again and again, and nothing happens, then that is 4 weeks of wasted effort. So, try something new! Try calling that agency instead. Or try calling some other agencies you know of, or, even some of their nearest competitors. If you’re as good as you say you are, at what you do, they’ll happily take your call! You’ll do well, if you persevere, in a professional way, and deserve it.</p>

<p>Also, know that 70-80% of all work (paid work) is actually found through networking, rather through advertised vacancies, (it really is - that is the plain truth of things!). So, if you can get people you know of already, to give you a referral, perhaps someone in a company you have worked at before, who already has quite a high opinion of you, then that should significantly increase your chances of securing a position in a company where there is a vacancy!</p>

<p>Then, try to be proactive! So be seen, and get known, and try to take as many opportunities as you can to meet with people socially! Whilst a certain amount of networking can be done over the telephone, there is really nothing better than just going out, and meeting people in person, and telling them a little bit more about yourself, about the things you have done in the past, the things you are currently doing, and the kinds of companies or industries you might like to work in next, and what you think the challenges and problems are in that industry, which you think you might be able to help with – (remember to have a printed copy of your CV, or business card, if you have one).</p>

<p>I think also, what a lot of people sometimes overlook, at least when it comes to business networking, is that anyone you meet, could potentially be a useful business network contact. I know, a lot of the time, people prefer to just engage in their own private screening process. There is obviously, a line to be drawn, between talking to just anyone and everyone in the street, and talking to no one - but if you want to network more, in a way that you consider to be successful, there might be more events, situations, or places, than you “think”, that might qualify as “the right” opportunity!</p>

<p>I also think, and I think this is very important, is to go out with the right mindset! Go out with the mindset of offering your knowledge, skills, ideas, resources, and guidance freely – without any ‘hooks’ or “expectations’ or “repayment” in any form. Doing this, as you ask thoughtful questions, about the person you are meeting (rather than questions that bluntly and directly try to further your own interests), will help establish empathy! This way, even if you go out expecting nothing in return, the receiver just might be left with a very positive experience and memory of you, which they can act on (if they so choose), at some point in the future! You just never know!</p>

<p>Also, be prepared. Have some crisp information about yourself available so that your communications are short, focused and clear, in the time you have with that person. Then of course, as mentioned earlier, try to have a good business card. Always try to be friendly, warm and sincere, and focus carefully on trying to learn (and remember!) people’s names. Ask for, and keep a copy of their business card, if you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep on networking, if you need to, even when you think you can stop! (But stay organised)
I know this might sound like a lot of advice, but I think you really need to keep working on all of these areas!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin! This is really helpful advice! One thing I’d like to ask is you, is what do you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses. Also, how do you maintain a positive mindset? Because, like many others, I am guessing that you too have your ups and downs, and go through some good spells and some bad spells. What helps you stay positive?</strong></p>

<p>Well, in terms of strengths: I feel that one strength I have come to develop, and have gotten better at, over time, is commitment and focus. I think whatever you want to do, you should be really focused! For example, in an athletics classes, you might find people who run to a line, but then stop three quarters of the way there, and start walking. You need to try to keep running! Whatever you want to do, you should be wholly committed, and focused!</p>

<p>Another strength I feel I have is being able to better approach things with an open mind. For example, writing management reports, or giving presentations, or doing public speaking, weren’t things I had that much practice in before my MBA. It wasn’t something I had to do much of before, in my earlier roles at PwC. But knowing how important these skills were, I was really determined to work very hard at trying to improve these skills. And over time, these are things I feel I have become better at!</p>

<p>In terms of weaknesses, I feel that sometimes I tend to struggle with time management - or I am always trying to find the right between both “time” management, and “attention” management.</p>

<p>I think personally, perhaps, I can further build on and develop my leadership, communication, and negotiation skills.</p>

<p><em>How do I keep a positive mindset, and stay resilient when times are tough?</em></p>

<p>Well, I do this, partly by practicing gratitude! People often think that, in life, “happy people” are just born lucky – maybe because they were born in a wealthy family, born charismatic, born athletic, or born with other certain traits and abilities. But, really, happiness is a choice!</p>

<p>There are many things we can be grateful for!</p>

<p>For example, you could at any point, pay somebody to cook for you, and then have them clean things up for you afterwards – you can go to a restaurant! Getting cooked and served food is something that so many people take for granted, because, in some parts of the world, they are so used to it!</p>

<p>I am also grateful for the fact that I have something called a refrigerator, where I keep and store food, so that it doesn’t go off. Other parts of the world, people don’t have a refrigerator!</p>

<p>Another example is that when I turn the tap on, I get clean water. In many countries you can’t do that one thing; so that’s something to be really grateful for!</p>

<p>I think the act of practicing gratitude is something that is so very countercultural. We always like to complain about poor customer service! Practicing gratitude is something that really requires great discipline!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin! Now, if you don’t mind, I have another question about Leadership. What would you say are some of the most successful character properties that one might need to have as a successful business leader?</strong></p>

<p>I think number one would be humility and responsiveness to feedback!</p>

<p>Often, as a leader, followers will want to just passively follow you, and do whatever you say. For example, you might think that because I’m the leader, I’ve gotten to the top, I know more than these other people, they will just follow me. But a lot of what you get from an organisation, is actually what you get from tapping into the other people!</p>

<p>Another thing I would say is that a leader who is too autocratic is not using the power of his or her employees. For example, when I was on a tour at one of the Hitachi GST factories in Japan, I was shown by one of their Senior Engineers, how a recent, new part of their production processs, had actually been inspired through one of their employees suggestion schemes. It wasn’t the leader, the head of the department who thought, I know best, let me design it – the leader, in this case, listened to his and her employees.</p>

<p>Number two, I think, is being creative.</p>

<p>I remember, over one of the summers after my MBA, reading this book called Zero to One, by Peter Thiele, the founder of PayPal. It is also a book that Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, – another person I greatly admire – also recommends.</p>

<p>In the book, Peter Thiele says that one of the most difficult things, when trying to start a breakthrough company is moving from “Zero to One”, rather than from “One to a Hundred”. Peter Thiele (&amp; Elon Musk) had created the very first online mobile payment system, PayPal – that was a “Zero to One”!</p>

<p>Now, there can be lots of replica companies, moving from “One to a Hundred”, but to do the first one, to move from “Zero to One” is extremely challenging! Peter Thiele, (&amp; Elon Musk), understood the importance of being able to think outside the box!</p>

<p>Third, just as with many other things, as I mentioned before, is commitment and focus!</p>

<p>You can’t be all things to all people! Peter &amp; Elon both thought, let’s just focus on launching PayPal, rather than thinking, I’ve got 100 ideas, let me try to look at them, all at the same time!</p>

<p><strong>Well Sachin, thanks for sharing your thoughts on this topic. I’m sure many of our readers will find learning more about Leadership really useful in their own careers and lives.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now, I don’t want to say, “what’s next?”, because it’s pretty obvious you’re doing quite well, and plan to stick with the kind of work you are doing, for some time. You’re still so young, so is there a dream that is still to come, another goal that you’re working towards? What are you looking to do next Sachin? What is going to continue to motivate you?</strong></p>

<p>That’s a good question!</p>

<p>Well, overall, my work philosophy will always be to try to give myself, and other people the opportunity to be themselves! For the people who work with me, for people I work with, if I feel I can make a positive change and positive difference to their lives, that means I can carry on with doing fulfilling work!</p>

<p>Now, if another opportunity presented itself, where I felt I could do something similar to what I have been doing, maybe in an industry that is very close to the industry I am currently in, then I guess I might be very open minded to that!</p>

<p>But as of now, I’m quite happy to continue doing what I am doing, providing what “I believe” to be an innovative business-technology service to companies in the “Technology &amp; Engineering” &amp; “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors.</p>

<p>Though, overall, I think it is impossible to exactly predict the future. And that’s what can make life so exciting! If new opportunities came my way, I wouldn’t just say: “<em>oh I never thought of this, let me just ignore this</em>”, I’d probably still remain very open minded to it! But this also doesn’t mean that I am “<em>going to be blown by the wind!</em>” - I am still going to maintain my “<em>focus</em>”. But, if a new opportunity did come along, and I decided that was for me, then that would be something I would directionally steer myself towards.</p>

<p><em>What is going to continue to motivate me?</em></p>

<p>These would just be my passions and interests – working with a bunch of smart, knowledgeable, hardworking, motivated people, that want to create and build new and innovative things to solve challenging, real-world problems.</p>

<p>I think a fast-growing Special FX studio, CGI Film Studio, A.I. / Machine Leaning driven - Electric Car Company, Hi-Tech Drone / Toy company, or even A.I. driven Health-Tech Start-up, supported by a large Corporate, or well-known Investor, might be other things I might be interested in helping support or being a part of!</p>

<p>Right now, though, I am just enjoying, employing my Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics skills, combined with what I know and have learnt in  Finance; Marketing, Human Resourcing, Entrepreneurship, and Business Strategy skills – to be a force for good for both business and society at large, something I hope to continue to do in my current and future roles.</p>

<p>Some colleagues in my business network sometimes even still ask me for some help in building “Financial Business Acquisitions” models, or some help with creating “Business Intelligence and Visual Data Analytics” reports. (I have had some requests).</p>

<p>I would like to improve the overall performance of those businesses that invite me to work for them – by better connecting the flows of information between across different business functions, in a smarter, more robust, and flexible way!</p>

<p>Doesn’t the Nike Slogan, from the series of adverts they used to run some time ago say: “<em>Impossible is Nothing!</em>”. Things are possible, if you really keep thinking, trying, and putting your mind to it.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for that Sachin! Well, you definitely seem to be heading in the right direction! I think we’re nearing the end of this talk now. So now, I’d like to ask you two further questions, if you don’t mind. What do you think has made you the person you are today?</strong></p>

<p>Good question!</p>

<p>I’m think I’m just the combined product of all my past experiences.</p>

<p>Was it Chuck Palanuick who said, “<em>Nothing of me is original. I am just the combined effort of everything and everybody I have ever known”</em></p>

<p>I think there is a lot of truth to this saying! Over the years, I think I have just been extremely lucky to have worked with friends, work colleagues, career coaches, and mentors who have just instilled in me some great character!</p>

<p>And this is just huge luck of the people I’ve had the opportunity to work with – and why I still strongly believe that meeting new people and opening yourself out to new and different experiences, is critically important for your own personal development!</p>

<p><strong>What is your definition of wealth and a successful life?</strong></p>

<p>I think there is no clear definition, because it means different things to different people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For some people, financial wealth is very important, not necessarily because they are materialistic, but because it is something their family never had – and this is one way they can achieve that level of comfort.</li>
  <li>For other people, it might be success with their career</li>
  <li>For some it might be family with other people.</li>
  <li>For others, it might be health and fitness.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me personally, after living in two very small rooms in London, I think my definition of wealth and a successful life, would be some combination of all of the above! You know,… the usual of what men seem to want these days, a large room, with a desk(!), a (solar powered) house, a nice modern (hybrid-electric) sports car, a nice kitchen, some gadgets and electronics, girlfriend/wife, financial security, etc., etc.</p>

<p>I think, if there was to be a very strict definition of wealth and a successful life – it would be an intangible and general one – to just be happy and fulfilled, in whatever it is you do or want to do! But that of course, will mean different things to different people!</p>

<p>If you wake up and feel, “<em>I’m grateful to have this day</em>”, then that is a sign of real success! But if you wake up and think, “<em>I just need to get through this day</em>”, then that is a sign you might want to do something different!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin, that was really thoughtfully answered! Now, through your journey as a business person, can you tell us something that you’ve learnt, just about life, not necessarily about business, but just about life, and people. Is there any bit of advice in general, or thing(s) that you’ve learnt, that you’d like to pass on to our readers?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it’s a very, very small world, and you should never – you must never – burn your bridges, because it will always come back round to you, in the end, at some point in time, or through some channel! All of your actions, and all of your reactions, and the way you treat people, will always come back to you!</p>

<p>You know, that kind of golden rule, “<em>do onto others as you’d like done onto you</em>”. That sort of thing, is something that really resonates with me, and I think, strongly in business, more generally.</p>

<p>Integrity is something you cannot regain!</p>

<p>I’ve seen time and time again, people burn their bridges, push themselves into a corner, and overreact, and overreact badly! (I’ve been guilty of it myself sometimes). But it does no one any favours! So, my one piece of advice would be just that.</p>

<p>Then, my second piece of advice would be to just be true to yourself. Work out what it is that inspires you and gets you out of bed in the morning! What are the one or two things that you really feel passionate about? Then put 110% of yourself behind achieving those things! I know it’s very general, but that’s the best way to achieve your goals.</p>

<p><strong>One last question, and I promise this will be the last. Why did you choose the name Star Tech Enterprises for the venture you currently work through as a freelancer? That’s quite an interesting name!</strong></p>

<p>Well, I had articulated that I wanted my mission to be one that would “<em>support businesses around the world – anywhere from large multi-nationals, medium-sized companies, to small and innovative start-ups, and help them achieve more! – particularly those in the Technology &amp; Engineering, and Media &amp; Entertainment sectors</em>”.</p>

<p>I wanted name of the company to reflect this in some way. So, I chose “<em>Star</em>”, as I saw that as something that indicated excellence – just like what you see in the night sky, this company too, would try to work with an ambition and standard that is “<em>hotly plasmonic</em>” – believing that every individual, if they truly love their work, should “<em>reach for the Stars!</em>”</p>

<p>Then word “<em>Tech</em>”, I chose because, personally, I believe in the continued application of science and technology, for the benefit of modern society – in making the systems and cultures we live in, more predictable, more effective, and more enjoyable, so that we may all live happier and healthier lives. That is why I wanted to include the word “<em>Tech</em>”.</p>

<p>Then I chose “<em>Enterprises</em>”, because, just like the great explorers of “<em>The Starship Enterprise</em>” from the TV series Star Trek (directed by J.J. Abrams), I wanted the company’s name to reflect the same values of its daring crew of voyagers, namely: “<em>to seek out new discoveries</em>” and “<em>to boldly go where no man or woman has gone before</em>” – always with an “<em>adventurous spirit</em>”, and always with a “<em>high sense of courage, boldness, and ingenuity!</em>”, which is why I chose the word “<em>Enterprises</em>”</p>

<p>Hence, the name “<em>Star-Tech Enterprises</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Sachin! Thank You very much! That was a very wide-ranging conversation! You have been having quite the career thus far. May it go well and continue to go well for you! I am certain many who read this will have learnt a lot from what you have shared.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If people want to reach you what is the best way for them to get in touch?</strong></p>

<p>It’s been an absolute pleasure, Harsh! Thank you for having me. I can be contacted on LinkedIn or via my email address: at <strong>sachin.tandon@startech-enterprises.com</strong></p>
