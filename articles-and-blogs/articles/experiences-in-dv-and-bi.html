<h2 id="freelance-experiences">Freelance experiences</h2>

<p>After finishing up with my MBA about 2.5 years ago, I thought the time might be right to see what it would be like to work as a freelancer through my own limited company. It was a tough choice, and partly driven by circumstances outside of my control (e.g. Brexit). Some big benefits I saw, though, of freelancing were the extra flexibility, freedom, and control I would get in choosing my own assignments - with the types of companies, industries I was most passionate about! And that definitely appealed to me!</p>

<p>So, that’s exactly what I did! I set up my own company and started freelancing, for those companies in those sectors I felt most passionate about - that is, when I could actually find the work, and when someone was willing to pay me! (but that’s another story!).</p>

<p>And over the the last 2 to 2.5 years, - since April 2016, the end of my MBA, I have been able to work on some incredible projects (mostly in the area of “<strong><em>Data Visualisation &amp; Business Intelligence</em></strong>”), for not just one, or two, but for several companies, in both the UK and abroad - and still, somehow, stay in business!</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the amazing project experiences I have been lucky enough to work on, which I thought I would share:</p>

<h2 id="jaguar-land-rover-automotives---project-1">Jaguar Land Rover, Automotives - Project 1</h2>

<p>This was work for one of the UK’s leading Automotive Companies, Jaguar Land Rover, a company that employs over 37,000 people, and turns over £24bn in annual revenue.</p>

<p>Here I was able to significantly reduce the complexity, and improve the efficiency of the work, carried out by the company’s Product Finance desk, the team responsible for tracking the location of all Jaguar Land Rover vehicles over the world - right from when they roll off the factory floor, to when they leave the factory gates, to when they are then transported to any one of the thousands of National and International Distribution Centres or Dealerships across the globe. So, it was quite important to the company the team did it’s work right!</p>

<p>Tasks that would otherwise have taken members of the desk 9-10 days to complete, I was able to achieve, after significant simplification and automation with some great software, in less than 3 days! For things the team just didn’t know how to do, or where to start, I also introduced to them the concept of what a process document was, and how to properly update one!</p>

<h2 id="the-landmark-group-retail---project-2">The Landmark Group, Retail - Project 2</h2>

<p>Outside the Automotive Industry, this project was for one of the largest multi-national retailers in the Middle East, one with over 500+ retail stores, and presence across over 21 countries!</p>

<p>Here, with close support from other staff members, I was able to create a complete, and comprehensive MI reporting solution, that gave the company’s procurement department, for the first time, a much better overall picture into how the department’s budget was being spent. They were now able to see much more quickly, and accurately areas such as (i) contract vs non-contract spend; (ii) purchase request approval times; and (iii) spend by different buyers on different vendors. The Department Heads, and other company Senior Executives, ended up being really impressed with the work!</p>

<h2 id="happy-ratio-fmcg---project-3">Happy Ratio, FMCG - Project 3</h2>

<p>Away from the multi-nationals, this project was for a fast-growing international start-up developing a new kind macro-nutrient health drink, in India. The company had been doing amazingly well, selling in several cities across the country through both online and offline channels.</p>

<p>When the company started exploring the idea of selling internationally, and began engaging in talks and negotiations with their wholesale distributors, they called me to see if I could help them develop a scenario and sensitivity model that they could use, so they could more easily see how much they could reduce their prices by in the negotiations, but still make a worthwhile profit. Since delivering the project, the company has gone on to experience continued success.</p>

<h2 id="jl-rohatgi-eye-hospital---project-4">JL Rohatgi Eye Hospital - Project 4</h2>

<p>This project was work in the healthcare industry, for a District Eye Hospital. Here, from scratch, I was able to develop a completely new M.I. reporting system for the Hospital’s Administrative Department, that gave them, for the first time, much better visibility into the financial performance of their different Hospital Units.</p>

<p>Now, instead of having to wait months just to get the right report, they could see performance within a matter of just 2 to 3 days - for example, which Hospital units were performing well, not so well, where the growth opportunities were, and importantly, which areas were in need of greater investment. They liked the work so much that they called me back to do similar work for them the following year, as demand for their services had rapidly picked up!</p>

<h2 id="wpp-marketing--advertising---project-5">WPP, Marketing &amp; Advertising - Project 5</h2>

<p>This was a 12 month project at WPP, the global marketing and communication agency, at their offices in London, working across several areas, in both their Finance and HR departments. The projects were fun and varied here!</p>

<p>For example, working with several country, regional, and global CFOs, I was able to design and implement more robust Financial Reporting solutions that provided, quicker, more real-time visibility into areas such as: Actual, Budgeted, and Forecast: Sales, Profits, and Margins, Net Working Capital, and Sales-to-Profit conversion ratios.</p>

<p>In their HR department, I was also able to resolve several process failures around the transparency and review of salary raise requests across the EMEA region, by introducing greater automation, and providing the agency’s other offices (and HR departments!) with clearer guidance, and instructions into how to put through salary raise requests.</p>

<p>For the HR department, I was also able to develop a new “<em>Data Visualisation</em>” reporting solution that provided the agency with first-time insights into their reporting of Gender Pay, covering areas such as: Staff Headcounts, Average and Median Staff Salaries, Years of Service, and Annual Compensation Ratios, by Gender, and Department.</p>

<p>I received very positive feedback from all the CFOs and HR Directors for my work, that they ended up extending my contract from initially only 3 months, 4 times, to a complete year!</p>

<h2 id="corporate-venture-capital-firm-venture-capital---project-6">Corporate Venture Capital Firm, Venture Capital - Project 6</h2>

<p>This project was for a FTSE 100 Corporate Venture Fund, helping them to automate several workflows so they could more quickly and accurately visualise the performance of their portfolio companies.</p>

<p>It was an exciting Venture Capital firm to work with - they were investing in innovative drinks start-ups that one day aspire to one day become global drinks brands too! So, it was just an incredible privilege to just get the chance to work with that kind of company! Needless to say, they also liked my work too!</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>I have been working as a freelancer on mostly “<strong><em>Data Visualisation and Business Intelligence</em></strong>” projects with decent success for the past 2 to 2.5 years, so it is something I hope to be able to continue to do, at least for the next few years in some capacity.</p>

<p>Personally, I find the field fascinating, and the more I learn about it, the more enjoyment and satisfaction I get from it - I get to solve some really tough, and challenging ‘real-world’ problems, and it is something that my clients, small or large, all seem to really, really like! - So why stop?</p>

<p>The entire field is only likely to evolve and grow for the forseeable future, particularly as businesses’ data requirements grow, and many struggle to keep up with their own data needs.</p>

<p>So, for someone like me, there are likely to still be a lot exciting projects out there! Fingers crossed!</p>
